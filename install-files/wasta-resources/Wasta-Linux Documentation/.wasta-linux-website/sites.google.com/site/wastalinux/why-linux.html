<p>In
 2012, our Organization which supports translation and literacy projects in NE Africa began computer
 operating system migration from Windows XP to Linux (Update: as of 
March 2014, <i>all machines</i> in this NE Africa location have been migrated to Linux).</p>
<p>I would like to explain our motivation for making this choice, the 
outcome of this move as we have seen so far, and why we feel that Linux 
is the best operating system for national colleagues and partners with 
low education and technical skills.  <u><i>I also want to be clear up front in suggesting that</i></u> <u><i>our Organization should seriously consider increasing efforts to enable 
users in developing countries to use Linux in their Bible translation 
and literacy efforts.</i></u><br />
<br />
Largely our consideration of Linux as the preferred option has come 
through several years of observation of computer use by national 
partners and colleagues that have low levels of formal education and are
 "new to computers".  Yet these users are involved with language, 
literacy, and Bible translation work, often working independently 
without adequate training or supervision.  Often I see these individuals
 struggle with several aspects of Microsoft Windows that prevent them 
from growing in their productive use of computers as a major tool in 
their work.<br />
<br />
In my observations, I have found that Linux has addressed many of these 
problems in freeing them to focus on the work at hand rather than being 
confused and challenged by repeated issues with Microsoft Windows.  
While we are able to largely address many of these "repeated problems 
with Microsoft Windows" with our Organization-owned computers and directly managed 
and employed staff computers, <i><u>these continual problems are</u></i> <i><u><b>real</b></u></i> <i><u>in
 the day-to-day world of those that we are coming alongside in the 
broader efforts of Bible translation and literacy such as partner 
organizations and other individuals using their own personal computers 
for the work</u></i>.  I hope that through the following discussion some
 of these inherent problems with Windows and the suggestive solutions 
that Linux addresses will be made more clear.<br />
</p>
<h3><a name="TOC-Linux-is-Free-but-is-it-viable-for-our-work-"></a>
<b>Linux is Free, but is it "viable for our work"?</b></h3>
<p>
Obviously the main argument people may use when promoting Linux is that 
it is "free" (it doesn't cost money).  Of course this is quite relevant 
when considering our target users in a developing-world context that 
struggle to make it day-to-day to meet the food and shelter needs of 
their families.  But I think we all understand this issue, and want to 
save money where possible.  Some skeptics may suggest that "it is free 
but it isn't viable for our work".  I suggest otherwise, and hope to 
outline some of the reasons as I go along in this discussion.<br />
<br />
So, indeed the cost savings of moving to Linux would be quite 
significant for our Organization but also especially for nationals partnering 
alongside us in the efforts, especially when the recurring costs of 
anti-virus software and the costs of Microsoft Office are added.<br />
<br />
Yet I am not going to talk much about Linux not costing money since the 
main point is that it needs to be seen as viable for use first before 
the cost savings can even be considered.  <i><u>For this reason, rather 
than discussing cost savings, I want to focus on the other benefits of 
Linux being free, in a much broader sense of the word that implies 
"freedom for the users".</u></i>  Much of the rest of my discussion will
 center around the ways that this freedom makes Linux the best choice 
for many of our computer usage situations in our Organization, 
particularly in the developing world context.<i><br />
</i></p>
<h3><a name="TOC-Free-means-Free-from-Viruses-currently-but-also-read-on-about-Linux-s-better-chances-at-staying-this-way-in-the-future-"></a>
<b>Free means Free from Viruses</b> <b>(currently, but also read on about Linux's better chances at staying this way in the future)</b></h3>
<p>

The main benefit that my African IT colleague sees with Linux is that it
 is largely considered virus-free.  One of the biggest struggles for 
this colleague is helping Windows users fix up major "virus messes".  He
 spends a lot of time trying to keep their anti-virus software up to 
date and running.  Yes, products such as NOD32 or Symantec Endpoint are 
more effective than many of the "free" anti-virus options (<i>not "free 
as in freedom" as I will refer to here but only free as in "no payment 
required" and subjecting the user to included advertising, continual 
reminders to upgrade to the paid "pro" version, and additional bloatware
 installed "for free"</i>).  But the challenges of keeping everything 
up-to-date and organized with poor internet connections, license 
management, etc., in a world that has many diverse demands placed on him
 means that in practice this IT colleague often is not successful in 
keeping things working smoothly for Windows users.  It takes a lot of 
organization to take advantage of the cost savings and "keep on top of 
things", and often he is distracted with other pressing issues.<br />
<br />
After a machine is compromised, of course the first thing viruses do are
 disable the anti-virus tools and their updates, etc., so it gets to be a
 complicated bit of cleanup.  This colleague's strengths are many, <i>but they are not in areas of organization and being detail-oriented</i>. 
 It is very important to note that I would suggest many of our national 
colleagues or partners that didn't grow up in a highly-academic society 
probably aren't as detail-oriented as consistent and organized computer 
use and management requires.  The result is that often these cleanup 
tasks are not fully completed, meaning that in practice there are many 
vulnerable machines floating in and out of our offices.  For example, 
the "market" is used for color print jobs, and it is guaranteed that 
after someone prints at the market they return to their personal 
computer and then viruses such as the "hide all your valid files" 
problems appear, even though these machines have paid licenses of 
professional anti-virus installed, yet may be negligently behind in 
their updates.<br />
<br />
Our "Organization owned machines" are largely immune to these daily hindrances 
due to auto-run being disabled and running corporate licenses of 
Symantec Endpoint with scheduled updates applied.  <i><u>But in this 
Reinvention-era of "enabling partner organizations", it is very clear 
that we as trained Organization members and staff that have access to discounted 
software are not the only ones we need to strongly consider.</u></i>  
Personal users and national partners in and out of our offices don't 
have such access to discounted security tools, and we don't have full 
control of their computers to provide it even if it is legally usable. <br />
<br />
It is a continual headache and cycle of confusion, time, and concern.  Many have stated that the <b>number 1 reason</b> they are wanting to go with Linux is because of the virus problems with Windows.<br />
<br />
The most obvious reason Linux doesn't have the virus and malware 
problems of Windows is because it has a much smaller market share.  
Indeed in the future, however, Linux can (and will) be targeted by virus
 and malware hackers.  But I think that Linux will remain resistant for 
two main reasons:<br />
    1.  Linux was designed "from the ground up" as a networked operating
 system.  Rather than needing to "patch in security features after the 
fact" like "Windows User Access Control" that showed up with Windows 
Vista and later, Linux has been designed <i>from the beginning</i> as a multi-user networked system with "smart authorization" required for system modifications.<br />
    2.  Since Linux is open source, it means the code is available for 
anyone to review.  The common saying is "More eyes make fewer security 
flaws".  It may take a motivated individual to do this, but these same 
motivated individuals can also apply patches should they find a possible
 vulnerability.  There doesn't have to be a "waiting and hoping that the
 corporation will fix its security flaw".  Proprietary software, by 
being closed, is inherently unknown and un-reviewed by the outside world
 as to the potential loopholes that could be maliciously exploited.<br />
</p>
<h3><a name="TOC-Free-means-Freedom-to-Choose-which-means-Linux-can-be-more-Simple-for-Our-Users"></a>
<b>Free means Freedom to Choose, which means Linux can be more Simple for Our Users</b></h3>
<p>

One "negative" brought up by many about Linux is that there are "too 
many choices", making it complicated for a new user to know which 
direction to go.  Indeed, there are many different desktop environments,
 as they are called, to choose from with Linux.  I argue, however, that 
this just means it is more difficult for experienced IT people such as 
myself to make a decision as to what is the preferred direction to 
promote to developing-world friends and colleagues.  So, I do have 
additional work in continually evaluating the available options.<br />
<br />
<u><i>But with these many choices comes the freedom to use an environment that is well tailored for these targeted users.</i></u>  The version of Linux I am using and promoting is <a href="http://itconnect.info/group/linux-desktop/page/wasta-linux" rel="nofollow">Wasta-Linux</a>,
 which is a customized version of Linux Mint using the Cinnamon desktop 
environment.  Cinnamon provides a familiar "Windows XP look and feel" 
for the user: in our testing with national users this familiarity is 
very important for those making the transition to Linux.  Many in the 
Linux world want something "different than Windows", but in our use-case
 I feel it is important to emphasize that day-to-day usage doesn't have 
to be much different from a familiar "Windows style workflow".  Since 
Linux can run our core applications like Paratext, FieldWorks, Adapt-It,
 Libre Office, Thunderbird, Firefox, Skype, etc., the familiarity of 
application use is also there for beginning users.<u><br />
</u><br />
Contrast this familiarity of Linux Mint Cinnamon with Windows 8's TIFKAM
 "The Interface Formerly known as Metro" (now referred to as the "Modern
 UI", I believe) that has been "forced on users" (I recently visited 
some computer shops in the US and they are not allowed to sell a machine
 loaded with Windows 7, or even sell stand-alone copies of Windows 7, to
 the salesman's great frustration).  Indeed the "Modern UI" may even 
have several benefits after a person "gets used to it" or if one has a 
"touch screen", but for our targeted low-tech national users it is going
 to take significant training efforts to use.  The complication and 
confusion for national users I have tested Windows 8 with means that 
there will be a huge learning curve for them in feeling comfortable with
 such a different paradigm.<br />
<br />
Yes, there are 3rd-party add-ons that can get Windows 8 to only use the 
familiar "desktop mode".  But these add-ons can't do it all as there are
 things such as Control Panel settings that will jump the user back in 
"Modern UI mode" leaving a beginning user very uncomfortable and 
confused.  The whole Windows 8 system has been designed by Microsoft to 
have this "dual personality" of the "Modern UI tablet style mode" merged
 together with the "familiar desktop mode".  Certainly in my view it is a
 system suffering from a split personality.<br />
<br />
Due to negative feedback, there are rumors that <i>maybe</i> Microsoft 
will concede and allow users to make the change themselves to have an 
option to start in the traditional desktop mode (and as of Windows 8.1 
they have brought back the "traditional start menu inside of desktop 
mode", although it is just a shortcut to launch the "Modern UI mode", 
which hasn't left users fully satisfied: Rumors are flying around that 
Windows 9 will finally give the "traditional menu" back to the user).  
But these changes are an unknown, and as users we are completely 
dependent on what Microsoft deems best for the world since we have a 
lack of choice and input.<br />
<br />
The main point of this controversy surrounding the Windows 8 Moderin UI for us is that since Windows is NOT free <u><i>there
 is no freedom to choose a different main layout to the system for users
 that may not meet the marketing segment that Microsoft is focusing on</i></u>. 
 I would suggest that, unfortunately, our developing-world colleagues 
and partners will never be able to gain this focus from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Back to NE Africa and our switch to <a href="http://itconnect.info/group/linux-desktop/page/wasta-linux" rel="nofollow">Wasta-Linux</a>,
 the national users I have helped switch to Wasta-Linux have now
 been operating independently for well over a year (as Organizational ex-pats have 
had to strategically withdraw due to various issues).  I just had a Skype
 call a few days ago with one of them who has only been using computers 
for 2 years.  In fact, 2 years ago I spent an entire morning with him 
helping him practice logging in and logging out (the most difficult part
 was the "capital A" in his password which was a learning lesson for 
me!).  On the Skype call he indicated he doesn't have any problems and 
that the few questions he has have been answered.  He is working daily 
with Paratext, LibreOffice, and Thunderbird, and had only been using 
Linux for 2 months when I left NE Africa (and had never received more 
training than "here is how to start the computer, here is where your 
programs are, here is how to shutdown").  I am glad I don't have to 
consider where he would be right now should I have migrated him to 
Windows 8 and then had to leave.  <u><i>Likely he would be able to do 
his work with Windows 8, but I am very happy to have been able to leave 
him with a much more simple system to use, that he can confidently 
promote to others he interacts with.</i></u><br />
<br />
In summary, I think the choices in Linux that give an option to use a 
traditional layout like Cinnamon give us control to be able to target 
what will be most effective for our users and what will allow them to 
gain confidence in their use of computers.<br />

<h3><a name="TOC-Free-means-Freedom-to-Customize-which-means-Linux-installation-and-support-can-be-more-simple-for-our-national-IT-workers-and-others"></a>
<b>Free means "Freedom to Customize", which means Linux installation and
 support can be more simple for our national IT workers and others</b></h3>
<p>
Another feature of Linux being "free as in freedom" means that people 
such as myself or the LSDev Linux group in Calgary (developing Balsa) 
are able to "customize Linux installs" to be tailored for our specific 
use-cases.  What I have done for our location in NE Africa is create a 
custom ISO of <a href="home.html">Wasta-Linux</a>
 that is fully tailored and set up with all the software and settings 
needed for any national user in that location, including keyboards, 
fonts, language settings, software selections, etc.<br />
<br />
To the benefit of the broader Organization world, Wasta-Linux <a href="home/customizing.html">can act as a "base" for any region or area</a>
 that wants to further modify it by adding region-specific keyboards, 
standard training documents, etc., to have a ready-made installer 
customized for their situation.  In fact, this is happening now in 
multiple countries: <i><u>resulting in ready-to-install usable systems 
tailored for low-tech lowly-educated users (or high-tech highly-educated
 ones: the point is anyone can use it inside or outside our Organization!).</u></i><br />
<br />
Wasta-Linux then allows my African IT colleague to be much more 
efficient and successful in installing the system.  To see this, first 
let me explain how he does things with Windows and then compare that to 
what he does now with the customized Linux installer that I am able to 
keep updated and provide him for his use.<br />
<br />
For Windows, when he needs to re-install a system (often he goes this 
direction because the cleaning of viruses, etc., is much more difficult 
for him than a full wipe-and-install for severely crippled machines), my
 African IT colleague first installs the OS and the OS Updates. This 
requires a genuine Windows key, which is unlikely for individuals' 
personal computers to have, so we instead refer them to the "market".  
After installing Windows, he then searches for various possible missing 
drivers (he mainly only deals with sound, video, and network drivers and
 ignores the other things that may not be working like the SD card 
reader, etc).  Then he installs the Anti-Virus, and then the various 
software applications.  Each of these installs require managing and 
referencing organized license lists: in the case where it is a personal 
user it may require applications, payments, transfers, etc.  Often the 
original keys for the user are missing or can't be found, so then 
re-application or email is sent to get all this organized.  Finally, 
after everything is installed, he then has to configure the system and 
software settings (which is often not done consistently, so then the 
user is confused by various things, so will later occasionally return to
 get extra things installed, re-configured, etc).  Often this colleague 
will spend a minimum of 1-2 full working days to do this work for one 
crippled machine.  Yes, there are tools that make this more efficient 
such as "wsus" to handle all the OS updates, etc., but again this takes 
organization and management which are not his strong points!<br />
<br />
Aside: Note that for our "Organization owned machines" we have "standard image 
backups" of machines that can be restored that have several of these 
steps accounted for.  If we consider our Organization machines only, then, much of 
this effort is not needed.  <i><u>However, again, I feel the need to 
emphasize that this age of re-imagining our our Organization interacts in the world and with partners implies we are looking far 
beyond Organizational-owned and directly managed computers.</u></i><i><u><br />
</u></i><br />
In contrast, when my colleague uses our customized Wasta-Linux 
installer, the most difficult part is getting the machine to boot from 
the USB flash drive installer.  Once he finds the key combination to 
boot from USB, the total install will take approximately 20 minutes.  
The system is already configured with all the software and settings 
necessary.  The complexity in doing it is reduced, and the resulting 
install is consistent and complete.  <u><i>Things such as Keyman 
keyboards, Thunderbird, Skype, office software (Libre Office), etc. are 
all there updated and ready for use.</i></u><br />
<br />
The install process is so easy I have worked with other "non IT support"
 national friends to teach them to install Wasta-Linux.  I would never 
consider this with the Windows process above.  In fact, I had one 
"pirated Windows computer market" shop owner wanting me to show him how 
to install Linux before I left NE Africa.  I regret not being able to 
show him at the time, since the simplicity of it would have likely quite
 surprised him.  <u><i>I would have loved to have seen the look on his face after he saw how easy it was to install Linux.</i></u><br />
</p>
<h3><a name="TOC-Free-means-Free-FOR-ALL-to-use-Genuine-Software-freedom-from-implicitly-supporting-software-Piracy-"></a>
<b>Free means Free FOR ALL to use Genuine Software (freedom from implicitly supporting software Piracy)</b></h3>
<p>

Much Windows software is free-of-cost, but what I have observed is that 
often these "free programs" come with "wrapper installers" that load 
additional toolbars in your web browser, install additional 
advertisement software, etc. that eventually bloat the system and 
confuse the user.  Yes, an experienced user will opt-out of these 
additional bloat-ware installs, but a novice ESL user will likely miss 
these "opt-out" options: leaving a system full of crud and possible 
conflicting utilities performing similar tasks but each doing things in 
ignorance of each other, <u><i>ultimately to the detriment of the user's experience</i></u>.<br />
<br />
Largely, however, the value in Linux being "genuine free software" means
 that the reasons behind and problems associated with pirated Microsoft 
software (Windows and Office) are made irrelevant.  Let's be honest: 
none of my NE Africa friends are going to pay the costs of genuine MS 
software if their machines weren't purchased with it pre-installed.  In 
NE Africa it is very common to purchase machines without genuine 
Microsoft software installed (instead pirated versions of Windows are 
used).<i> </i> In fact, it is quite difficult to even find a machine 
with genuine MS software to purchase, and if it is found, it is often 
identical to another machine but at a much higher price.  As Microsoft 
has gotten more advanced in their attempted prevention of pirated 
versions of Windows, the pirates have also gotten more advanced.  
Currently, I have observed in NE Africa that it is quite common for the 
BIOS of a computer to be hacked to allow a pirated version of Windows to
 be installed.  The result is that often the display drivers, network 
drivers, etc., are all confused and it is a very difficult situation to 
resolve.  So, regardless of the ethics of the situation, there are 
practical headaches introduced by pirated software.  I say "enough is 
enough" in this crazy cycle of Microsoft and the pirates continually 
attempting to "one-up" each other.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the practical problem of piracy, I strongly feel there are
 ethical concerns as well, even if many of the nationals I work with 
don't necessarily see this issue the same way I do.  Even where there is
 "no awareness of the illegality" of the situation, I want to urge us 
strongly that this is not an argument our Organizion should 
use to justify the situation to ourselves.  <i><u>For me as a western 
background volunteer worker in an overseas assignment, I have been freed from this conflict 
through the use and promotion of Linux.</u></i><br />
<br />
Many ex-pats may not think of these issues since they purchase machines 
with genuine MS Windows already installed.  I want to be clear that I am
 not suggesting that all Organization ex-pat consultants and advisors that have 
years of experience and expertise in MS Windows be <i>required</i> to 
switch to Linux.  I foresee those of us coming from "the privileged land
 of laptops coming with valid MS Windows" (and those of us who are able 
to properly maintain anti-virus definitions and avoid the pitfalls of 
"bloatware", "malware", etc.) be able to evaluate for ourselves what OS 
and Office program to use.  But for our national colleagues in the 
developing world (and the increasing number of nationals outside our 
direct work: church partners, literacy program partners, etc.), often 
the choices are different.  Often there isn't really a reasonable, 
cost-effective, viable choice for them to use Windows and MS Office 
(legally: and, again, the problem is not only one of "legality", but one
 of "quality": the hacked pirated versions have driver problems, 
potentially embedded viruses, etc. that make it a real headache to deal 
with even apart from morals).<br />
<br />
Again, Linux is not only free as in "no payment required"; it is also 
free as in "freedom".  Yes, there are discount (or fully covered) 
programs that many in language work in Africa are approved to use for 
Windows, anti-virus, office, etc., software (thanks to many for their 
efforts in this area to help make these items more reasonable for 
African workers!).  <i><u>However, "freedom" is much more preferred</u></i>:  Freedom means the user can re-distribute it, customize it to their use case, etc..  <u><i>It is free for anyone that comes through my office door</i></u>,
 including staff, partner organizations, personal computers, 
friends-of-friends computers, etc: not just employees or those that fit 
the criteria for "no-cost or discounted licenses".  Again, often these 
discount programs may require careful management of licenses to ensure 
compliance, which, yet again, are not necessarily strengths of our 
national colleagues that we need to empower to carry Bible translation 
and literacy forward.<br />
</p>
<h3><a name="TOC-Our-Organization-s-Re-visioning-for-the-Future:-Not-Why-Linux-but-Why-NOT-Linux-"></a>
<b>Our Organization's Re-visioning for the Future: Not "Why Linux?", but "Why <u>NOT</u> Linux?"</b></h3>
<p>

Some have suggested it is important to question why Linux should even be
 considered, since it just "spreads us too thin with our limited 
resources".  But in light of the above reasons, I feel it is important 
instead to ask, "Why NOT Linux?" It is fully functional for many of our 
targeted users.  It can be more simple for users, it can be more simple 
for IT support, it is free of cost, free of viruses, etc.: In large the 
consideration of Linux as a platform of choice for my national 
colleagues, partners, and friends counters a false underlying 
assumption: that we (Organizational members, national partners and colleagues, etc.) cannot
 be effective without Microsoft Office and Microsoft Windows.<br />
<br />
In light of our "Organizational Reinvention", we need to consider the "whole effort 
toward translation and literacy" rather than focusing only on "Organization-owned
 computers and Organization-administered translation projects".  <u><i>In NE 
Africa, we are trying to position ourselves to hopefully be able to move
 forward as a broad-based literacy and translation movement together 
with</i></u> <u><i>our national partners and the inclusive involvement of other nationals outside the Organization umbrella.</i></u> 
 Others in the Organization world I am sure are thinking along the 
same lines.  I think it is important to understand that these efforts 
may be hindered by perpetuating the continual false assumption that MS 
products are the only way to be productive.  With us supporting (and in 
many cases using) Linux, we ALL can have access to and use the same 
software to further the ends of Bible translation and literacy work in 
the world.  <i><u>Linux being free means that the solutions we are providing can "self-propagate" to everyone in a decentralized and ongoing way.</u></i><br />
<br />
To restate, what is happening in our part of NE Africa is certainly not 
an isolated case; other areas in our Organization are also moving this 
direction.  As we consider our Organizations re-visioning for the future, we need to find ways of 
supporting nationals and national partners, so that they can participate
 more and more in Good Book translation.  I see the opportunity to use Linux
 as a crucial step in this process for many people.  In the past, we 
have automatically focused on what is best and easiest for ex-pats, as 
ex-pats have been the ones making the leadership decisions and 
organizing the efforts.  But as we look toward migrating more to 
national administration and leadership, <u><i>I feel a key piece in 
supporting this shift is using and sharing with them the tools and 
technology most appropriate for their context</i></u>.  In this case, I feel it critical that we consider it highly possible that Linux may be best positioned to provide this.<br />
<br />
For the reasons laid out above I am suggesting that Linux being "free", 
"secure" and "simple" (for novice users with basic computing needs) best
 meets the needs of our targeted users in developing countries.  So, 
those of us that choose to use MS products (and other tools not 
available in Linux) can at a minimum do our best to facilitate 
compatibility and interoperability.  But let us make our "standard" be 
that which ALL of us can achieve (Linux gives us this option).</p><hr /><br /></div>* If you are curious about who we are and want to know more about our Organization's work, please leave a comment on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/wasta-linux-users" target="_blank">Wasta-Linux Users Forum</a> and someone will get in touch with you.
