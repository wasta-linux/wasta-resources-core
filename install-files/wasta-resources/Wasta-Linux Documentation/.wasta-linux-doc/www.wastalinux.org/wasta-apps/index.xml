      <description>Wasta-Menus: Main Menu Application Limiting Feature What is it? Wasta-Menus is a simple way to only display a limited number of pplications in the system&amp;rsquo;s Main Menu for the current user.
With Wasta-Menus enabled, a Wasta-Linux computer could serve as a kiosk omputer or it could be used by beginning users who only have only been ssigned a few specific tasks on the computer. In both cases it is referable to not overwhelm the user with ALL the installed Wasta-Linux pplications in the Main Menu, but rather present a limited set of them o the user.</description>

Wasta-Offline is a simple utility for updating or installing software packages on a Linux machine from a local &amp;lsquo;wasta-offline&amp;rsquo; folder, resulting in saving many hundreds of MB or even a few GB of internet downloads.
