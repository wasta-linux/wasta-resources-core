      <description>How to create a bootable USB from an ISO Image Using Windows For Windows users, the preferred tool to create a bootable USB device from an ISO Image is Rufus. Rufus has the advantage of not needing to be &amp;ldquo;installed&amp;rdquo;: a user can run it directly from the downloaded &amp;ldquo;.exe file&amp;rdquo;.
To use Rufus, first insert a 4GB (or greater) USB drive (WARNING! using the Rufus default settings, this USB drive WILL BE COMPLETELY REFORMATTED, so all data WILL BE LOST!</description>

      <description>Wasta-Linux: Customizing for your Needs [Wasta-Linux] (/&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt;}}) is intended to be used as a base for regionally-localized Linux &amp;ldquo;customized&amp;rdquo; distributions specific to locations&amp;rsquo; needs (fonts, keyboards, applications, settings, included reference documents, etc.). Should you be interested in being a &amp;ldquo;regional customizer&amp;rdquo; of Wasta-Linux, please use the forums linked at the bottom of this page and someone will contact you.
There are 2 primary Wasta-Linux customizing methods, both of which can be used to create custom Wasta-Linux ISOs to re-distribute to users:</description>

      <description>Wasta-Linux: Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to some of the more common questions you may have about Wasta-Linux. First, a question and response that lays the foundation for Wasta-Linux:
Why Linux? One colleague answered the question &amp;ldquo;Why Linux&amp;rdquo; concisely using 3 main points. In brief, Linux is:
 Partner friendly: share with everyone, not only privledged organizations that have corporate license keys Budget friendly: not only does it not have a cost, it will also save support time Customizing friendly: adapt Linux to your use case, rather than having to adapt your usage to the limitations of a locked-down operating system that may not have you in mind as their target user base  Basically it is about freedom (not just &amp;ldquo;free as in no cost&amp;rdquo;), which means freedom to customize for our situation and for our specific users (see more below on this topic), freedom for all to use it, and &amp;ldquo;free from viruses.</description>

      <description>Inplace Upgrades: Migrating between major versions of Wasta-Linux This guide is for migrating between major versions of Wasta-Linux (eg. from 16.04 to 18.04) when the machine does not have a separate home partition. Even without a separate home partition, this type of upgrade will not remove a user&amp;rsquo;s home directory and all files and settings from this &amp;lsquo;home&amp;rsquo; will be migrated to the new system.
 Backup Make sure important personal files are backed up in case something goes awry.</description>

      <description>Wasta-Linux: Maintain a Custom Package This page is part of the Wasta-Linux customizing process.
Git is used for version control of all the Wasta-Linux custom packages. There is a Wasta-Linux organization on GitHub that contains separate GitHub repositories for each Wasta-Linux custom package. Any changes that are pushed up to these repositories are automatically copied every 6 hours to Launchpad, which is Ubuntu&amp;rsquo;s site for managing software. Once the code is in Launchpad, there is another automatic process that builds the actual software packages and places them in the Wasta-Linux Testing Launchpad PPA.</description>

Before the VirtualBox Guest Additions are installed, it will not be possible to enable &amp;ldquo;3D Graphics&amp;rdquo;, which Cinnamon requires, and you will get a warning message when logging in that you are in &amp;ldquo;Software Rendering Mode&amp;rdquo;. There are a few quirks to getting these &amp;ldquo;Guest Additions&amp;rdquo; installed that are documented here.</description>

With Wasta-Menus enabled, a Wasta-Linux computer could serve as a kiosk omputer or it could be used by beginning users who only have only been ssigned a few specific tasks on the computer. In both cases it is referable to not overwhelm the user with ALL the installed Wasta-Linux pplications in the Main Menu, but rather present a limited set of them o the user.</description>
