      <description>Inplace Upgrades: Migrating between major versions of Wasta-Linux This guide is for migrating between major versions of Wasta-Linux (eg. from 16.04 to 18.04) when the machine does not have a separate home partition. Even without a separate home partition, this type of upgrade will not remove a user&amp;rsquo;s home directory and all files and settings from this &amp;lsquo;home&amp;rsquo; will be migrated to the new system.
 Backup Make sure important personal files are backed up in case something goes awry.</description>
